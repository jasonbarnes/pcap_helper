pcap_helper.h
Jason Barnes

The functions found in pcap_helper.h are designed to aid in reading offline
pcap files.  Currently, only one function exists: pcap_helper_open_offine.
It works by opening a pcap file and applying a function to every packet
in the file.

Explanation of arguments:

char *filename:	The filename of the pcap file to be read.

void (*func)(const struct pcap_pkthdr *, const u_char *, struct iphdr *, 
struct tcphdr *, void *):  A function pointer to your function to be applied to each packet.

void *func_data: A pointer to data that will be passed into func as the last argument.

Explanation of the function pointer func's arguments:
const struct pcap_pkthdr *:  A pointer to the pcap packet header for each packet.  
This is a struct that contains information specific to pcap, such as the 
timestamp of when the packet was captured, and how many bytes were captured.

const u_char *:  A pointer to the packet data, starting with the first byte of
the Ethernet header.

struct iphdr *:  If the packet is an IP packet, this will be a pointer to the start of the
IP header.  Otherwise, it will be NULL.

struct tcphdr *:  If the packet is a TCP packet, this will be a pointer to the start of the
TCP header.  Otherwise, it will be NULL.
